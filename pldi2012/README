HotCRP: Conference Review Package 2.47
======================================

New version by Eddie Kohler, UCLA
CRP originally by Dirk Grunwald, University of Colorado
banal by Geoff Voelker, UCSD

Prerequisites
-------------
HotCRP requires the following software.

* Apache			http://apache.org/
  (You may be able to use another web server that works with PHP.)
* PHP version 5 or higher	http://php.net/
  - Including MySQL and GD support
  - PHP 5.2 or higher recommended
* MySQL version 5 or higher	http://mysql.org/
* PHP PEAR extensions		http://pear.php.net/
* The zip compressor		http://www.info-zip.org/

Apache is preloaded on most Linux distributions.  You may need to install
additional packages for PHP, MySQL, GD, and PEAR, such as:

* Fedora Linux: php-mysql, php-pear, php-gd
* Debian Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear,
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x)
* Ubuntu Linux: php5-common, php5-gd, php5-mysql, php-pear,
  libapache2-mod-php5 (or libapache-mod-php5 for Apache 1.x), and a package
  for SMTP support, such as sendmail

You may need to restart the Apache web server after installing these
packages ("sudo apachectl graceful" or "sudo apache2ctl graceful").

Versions of the Mail and Mail_Mime PHP PEAR packages are currently
distributed as part of the HotCRP tarball (Mail 1.1.14, Mail_Mime 1.4.0).

Additional packages required for paper format checking:

* pdftohtml (0.39)	http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/
  OR
* pdftohtml (0.40b)	http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sigops/banal/download.html

  WARNING: The pdftohtml package has had several bugs that affect HotCRP.
  Version 0.39 is a reasonable choice.  (HotCRP will also work with version
  0.36, but font sizes are measured more precisely with version 0.39.)
  Unfortunately, version 0.39 does not understand PDF 1.5 documents, such
  as those generated by recent versions of Adobe Acrobat.  Version 0.40a,
  which does understand PDF 1.5, can be hundreds of times slower than
  version 0.39, and is impractical for HotCRP.  As of this writing, Geoff
  Voelker, banal's author, maintains a patched pdfhtml ("version 0.40b")
  that supports PDF 1.5 with good speed; see the link above.

Load notes: HotCRP requires a system with at least 256MB of memory, more if
paper format checking is used and submission load is expected to be high.
If you run HotCRP in a virtual machine, make sure you configure suitable
swap space!  If MySQL is killed due to memory shortages your database may
be corrupted.


Configuration
-------------
* Database initialization

  - Run "Code/createdb.sh" to create the database.  Use "Code/createdb.sh
    OPTIONS" to pass options to MySQL, such as --user and --password.  Many
    MySQL installations require privilege to create tables, so you may need
    "sudo Code/createdb.sh OPTIONS".  Run "Code/createdb.sh --help" for
    more information.  You will need to decide on a name for your database
    (no spaces allowed).

* Site configuration

  - Edit "Code/options.inc", which is annotated to guide you.
    ("Code/createdb.sh" creates this file based on "Code/distoptions.inc".)

  - Redirect Apache so your server URL will point at the HotCRP directory.
    (If you get an Error 500, see "Configuration notes".)  This will
    generally require adding a <Directory> for the HotCRP directory, and an
    Alias redirecting a particular URL to that directory.  For example,
    this section of httpd.conf makes the "/testconf" URL point at a HotCRP
    installation in /home/kohler/hotcrp.

	<Directory "/home/kohler/hotcrp">
	        Options Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks
	        AllowOverride all
	        Order allow,deny
	        Allow from all
	</Directory>
	Alias /testconf /home/kohler/hotcrp

    Note that the first argument to Alias should NOT end in a slash.  The
    "AllowOverride all" directive is required.

  - Update the systemwide setting for PHP's 'session.gc_maxlifetime'
    configuration variable.  This provides an upper bound on HotCRP session
    lifetimes (the amount of idle time before a user is logged out
    automatically).  On Unix machines, systemwide PHP settings are often
    stored in '/etc/php.ini'.  The suggested value for this setting is
    86400, e.g., 24 hours:

	session.gc_maxlifetime = 86400

    If you want sessions to expire sooner, we recommend you set
    'session.gc_maxlifetime' to 86400 anyway, then edit Code/options.inc to
    set '$Opt["sessionLifetime"]' to the correct session timeout.

  - Edit MySQL's 'my.cnf' (typical location: '/etc/my.cnf') to ensure that
    MySQL can handle paper-sized objects.  It should contain something like
    this:

       [mysqld]
       max_allowed_packet=32M

    max_allowed_packet must be at least as large as the largest paper you
    are willing to accept.  It defaults to 1M on some systems, which is not
    nearly large enough.  HotCRP will warn you if it is too small.  Some
    MySQL setups, such as on Mac OS X, may not have a 'my.cnf' by default;
    just create one.  If you edit my.cnf, also restart the mysqld server.
    On Linux boxes "sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld restart" often suffices.

  - Sign in to the site to create an account.  The first account created
    automatically receives system administrator privilege.

    If your server configuration doesn't allow .htaccess files to set
    options, Apache will report an "Error 500" when you try to load HotCRP.
    Change your Apache configuration to "AllowOverride All" in the HotCRP
    directory, as our example does above.

  - You can set up everything else through the web site itself.

* Configuration notes

  - Uploaded papers and reviews are limited in size by several PHP
    configuration variables, set by default to 15 megabytes in the HotCRP
    directory's ".htaccess".  You may want to lower them.

  - HotCRP PHP scripts can take a lot of memory, particularly if they're
    doing things like generating MIME-encoded mail messages.  By default
    HotCRP sets the PHP memory limit to 128MB.

  - HotCRP uses Apache's mod_expires module; consider enabling it.


Backing up the database
-----------------------
Run "Code/backupdb.sh" at the shell prompt to back up the database.  This
will write the database's current structure and comments to the standard
output.


Updating the code
-----------------
HotCRP code can be updated at any time without bringing down the site.
Simply copy the new version over your old code, preserving
Code/options.inc.  For instance, using GNU tar:

   % cd HOTCRPINSTALLATION
   % tar --strip=1 -xzf ~/hotcrp-NEWVERSION.tar.gz


Multiconference support
-----------------------
HotCRP has preliminary support for running multiple conferences out of a
single installation.  Edit options.inc to set $Opt["multiconference"] to 1.
The last directory component of the URL is used for the database name,
user, and password.  For instance:

   http://read.seas.harvard.edu/conferences/testconf/doc/testconf-paper1.pdf
                                            ^^^^^^^^
                                    last directory component

Alternately, you may set $Opt["dbName"], $Opt["dbUser"], and/or
$Opt["dbPassword"]. HotCRP will edit each of those settings to replace the
"*" character with the last directory component. (This replacement is also
performed on the sessionName, downloadPrefix, conferenceSite, and paperSite
options.)

You will still need to create a new database for each conference using the
"Code/createdb.sh" script, and convince your Apache to use the HotCRP
install directory for all relevant URLs.

To set other $Opt options per conference, such as the conference name and
contact email, modify the conference's Settings database table. A Settings
row with name "opt.XXX" takes precedence over option $Opt["XXX"]. For
example, to set a conference's longName:

    mysql> insert into Settings (name, value, data)
	   values ('opt.longName', 1, 'My Conference 2012')
	   on duplicate key update data=values(data);

Note that the "Code/backupdb.sh" script doesn't work for multiconference
installations, and that several important options, such as contactName and
contactEmail, cannot yet be set using the web interface.
